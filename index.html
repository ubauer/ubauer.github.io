<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We study the persistent homology of random Čech complexes. Generalizing a method of 
Penrose for studying random geometric graphs, we first describe an appropriate theoretical 
framework in which we can state and address our main questions. Then we define the kth 
persistent Betti number of a random Čechcomplex and determine its asymptotic order in 
the subcritical regime. This extends a result of Kahle on the asymptotic order of the ordinary 
kth Betti number of such complexes to the persistent setting.

<b>Abstract:</b> 
We call a continuous self-map that reveals itself through a discrete set of point-value pairs a 
sampled dynamical system. Capturing the available information with chain maps on 
Delaunay complexes, we use persistent homology to quantify the evidence of recurrent 
behavior, and to recover the eigenspaces of the endomorphism on homology induced by the 
self-map. The chain maps are constructed using discrete Morse theory for Cech and 
Delaunay complexes, representing the requisite discrete gradient field implicitly in order to 
get fast algorithms.

<td><strong>Ripser: a lean C++ code for the computation of Vietoris–Rips persistence barcodes
</strong><br>
Ulrich Bauer (2015–2021). Licensed under MIT license.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Description:</b> 
Ripser is a lean C++ code for the computation of Vietoris–Rips persistence barcodes. It can do just this one thing, but does it extremely well.
<p>
The implementation is based on an implicit algorithmic representation of the coboundary operator and of the filtration order, avoiding the explicit construction of the filtration boundary matrix.
Our software shows significant improvements over existing software both in time and memory usage.
<p>
The source code consists of around 1000 lines of C++ code.
It supports for coefficients in prime finite fields and sparse distance matrices for computing the Vietoris–Rips persistence barcodes only up to a specified threshold.
No external dependencies are required.

<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We consider the setting of Reeb graphs of piecewise linear functions and study distances 
between them that are stable, meaning that functions which are similar in the supremum 
norm ought to have similar Reeb graphs. We define an edit distance for Reeb graphs and 
prove that it is stable and universal, meaning that it provides an upper bound to any other 
stable distance. In contrast, via a specific construction, we show that the interleaving 
distance and the functional distortion distance on Reeb graphs are not universal.

<b>Abstract:</b> 
We present an algorithm for the computation of Vietoris–Rips persistence barcodes and describe its implementation in the software Ripser. The method relies on implicit representations of the coboundary operator and the filtration order of the simplices, avoiding the explicit construction and storage of the filtration coboundary matrix.

<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We give a full classification of representation types of the subcategories of representations of an m×n rectangular grid with monomorphisms (dually, epimorphisms) in one or both directions, which appear naturally in the context of clustering as two-parameter persistent homology in degree zero. We show that these subcategories are equivalent to the category of all representations of a smaller grid, modulo a finite number of indecomposables. This equivalence is constructed from a certain cotorsion torsion triple, which is obtained from a tilting subcategory generated by said indecomposables.

<td><strong>Persistence Diagrams as Diagrams: A Categorification of the Stability Theorem
</strong><br>
Ulrich Bauer and Michael Lesnick.
Topological Data Analysis. Abel Symposia, vol 15. Springer (2020), 67–96.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Persistent homology, a central tool of topological data analysis, provides invariants of data 
called barcodes (also known as persistence diagrams). A barcode is simply a multiset of real 
intervals. Recent work of Edelsbrunner, Jablonski, and Mrozek suggests an equivalent 
description of barcodes as functors R-> Mch, where R is the poset category of real numbers 
and Mch is the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are matchings (ie, 
partial injective functions). Such functors form a category Mch^ R whose morphisms are the 
natural transformations. Thus, this interpretation of barcodes gives us a hitherto unstudied 
categorical structure on barcodes. The aim of this note is to show that this categorical 
structure leads to surprisingly simple reformulations of both the well-known stability theorem 
for persistent homology and a recent generalization called the induced matching theorem.

SODA '19: Proceedings of the 30th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (2019), 2663-2774.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We consider the approximability of maximization and minimization variants of the Morse 
matching problem, posed as open problems by Joswig and Pfetsch. We establish hardness 
results for Max-Morse matching and Min-Morse matching. In particular, we show that, for a 
simplicial complex with n simplices and dimension $ d\leq 3$, it is NP-hard to approximate 
Min-Morse matching within a factor of $ O (n^{1-\epsilon}) $, for any $\epsilon> 0$. 
Moreover, using an L-reduction from Degree 3 Max-Acyclic Subgraph to Max-Morse 
matching, we show that it is both NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate Max-Morse 
matching for simplicial complexes of dimension $ d\leq 2$ within certain explicit constant 
factors.

Our results have applications in topological data analysis and in the reconstruction of shapes from sampled data.

</strong><br>
Ulrich Bauer, Axel Munk, Hannes Sieling, and Max Wardetzky. 
Foundations of Computational Mathematics 17:1 (2017), 1–33.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We investigate the problem of estimating the number of modes (i.e., local maxima)—a well-known question in statistical inference—and we show how to do so without presmoothing the data. To this end, we modify the ideas of persistence barcodes by first relating persistence values in dimension one to distances (with respect to the supremum norm) to the sets of functions with a given number of modes, and subsequently working with norms different from the supremum norm. As a particular case, we investigate the Kolmogorov norm. We argue that this modification has certain statistical advantages. We offer confidence bands for the attendant Kolmogorov signatures, thereby allowing for the selection of relevant signatures with a statistically controllable error. As a result of independent interest, we show that taut strings minimize the number of critical points for a very general class of functions. We illustrate our results by several numerical examples.

</strong><br>
Ulrich Bauer, Barbara Di Fabio, and Claudia Landi. 
3DOR '16 Proceedings of the Eurographics 2016 Workshop on 3D Object Retrieval (2016), 27–34
<small> 
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We consider the problem of assessing the similarity of 3D shapes using Reeb graphs from the standpoint of robustness under perturbations. For this purpose, 3D objects are viewed as spaces endowed with real-valued functions, while the similarity between the resulting Reeb graphs is addressed through a graph edit distance. The cases of smooth functions on manifolds and piecewise linear functions on polyhedra stand out as the most interesting ones. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a general edit distance suitable for comparing Reeb graphs in these settings. This edit distance promises to be useful for applications in 3D object retrieval because of its stability properties in the presence of noise.

SoCG '14 Proceedings of the twenty-ninth annual symposium on Computational geometry (2014), 355–364.
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We define a simple, explicit map sending a morphism f: M → N of pointwise finite dimensional persistence modules to a matching between the barcodes of M and N. Our main result is that, in a precise sense, the quality of this matching is tightly controlled by the lengths of the longest intervals in the barcodes of ker f and coker f.
As an immediate corollary, we obtain a new proof of the algebraic stability of persistence, a fundamental result in the theory of persistent homology. In contrast to previous proofs, ours shows explicitly how a δ-interleaving morphism between two persistence modules induces a δ-matching between the barcodes of the two modules. Our main result also specializes to a structure theorem for submodules and quotients of persistence modules.

<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Topological data analysis offers a rich source of valuable information to study vision 
problems. Yet, so far we lack a theoretically sound connection to popular kernelbased 
learning techniques, such as kernel SVMs or kernel PCA. In this work, we establish such a 
connection by designing a multi-scale kernel for persistence diagrams, a stable summary 
representation of topological features in data. We show that this kernel is positive definite 
and prove its stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance. Experiments on two 
benchmark datasets for 3D shape classification/retrieval and texture recognition show 
considerable performance gains of the proposed method compared to an alternative

<td><strong>Strong equivalence of the interleaving and functional distortion metrics for Reeb graphs</strong><br>
Ulrich Bauer, Elizabeth Munch, and Yusu Wang. SoCG '15 Proceedings of the 31st International Symposium on Computational Geometry (2015), 461–475.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
The Reeb graph is a construction that studies a topological space through the lens of a real valued function. It has widely been used in applications, however its use on real data means that it is desirable and increasingly necessary to have methods for comparison of Reeb graphs. Recently, several methods to define metrics on the space of Reeb graphs have been presented. In this paper, we focus on two: the functional distortion distance and the interleaving distance. The former is based on the Gromov– Hausdorff distance, while the latter utilizes the equivalence between Reeb graphs and a particular class of cosheaves. However, both are defined by constructing a near-isomorphism between the two graphs of study. In this paper, we show that the two metrics are strongly equivalent on the space of Reeb graphs. In particular, this gives an immediate proof of bottleneck stability for persistence diagrams in terms of the Reeb graph interleaving distance.

<td><strong>A stable multi-scale kernel for topological machine learning</strong><br>
Jan Reininghaus, Stefan Huber, Ulrich Bauer, and Roland Kwitt. CVPR'15 Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (2015), 4741-4748.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Topological data analysis offers a rich source of valuable information to study vision 
problems. Yet, so far we lack a theoretically sound connection to popular kernelbased 
learning techniques, such as kernel SVMs or kernel PCA. In this work, we establish such a 
connection by designing a multi-scale kernel for persistence diagrams, a stable summary 
representation of topological features in data. We show that this kernel is positive definite 
and prove its stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance. Experiments on two 
benchmark datasets for 3D shape classification/retrieval and texture recognition show 
considerable performance gains of the proposed method compared to an alternative 
approach that is based on the recently introduced persistence landscapes.

<td><strong>Measuring Distance between Reeb Graphs</strong><br>
Ulrich Bauer, Xiaoyin Ge, and Yusu Wang. SoCG '14 Proceedings of the twenty-ninth annual symposium on Computational geometry (2014), 464–473.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We propose a metric for Reeb graphs, called the functional distortion distance. Under this distance measure, the Reeb graph is stable against small changes of input functions. At the same time, it remains discriminative at differentiating input functions. In particular, the main result is that the functional distortion distance between two Reeb graphs is bounded from below by (and thus more discriminative than) the bottleneck distance between both the ordinary and extended persistence diagrams for appropriate dimensions.
<br>
As an application of our results, we analyze a natural simplification scheme for Reeb graphs, and show that persistent features in Reeb graph remains persistent under simplification. Understanding the stability of important features of the Reeb graph under simplification is an interesting problem on its own right, and critical to the practical usage of Reeb graphs.

<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
We present a parallelizable algorithm for computing the persistent homology of a filtered chain complex. Our approach differs from the commonly used reduction algorithm by first computing persistence pairs within local chunks, then simplifying the unpaired columns, and finally applying standard reduction on the simplified matrix. The approach generalizes a technique by G&uuml;nther et al., which uses discrete Morse Theory to compute persistence; we derive the same worst-case complexity bound in a more general context. The algorithm employs several practical optimization techniques which are of independent interest. Our sequential implementation of the algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, and we improve the performance through parallelized computation.

<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Persistent homology is a popular and powerful tool for capturing topological features of data. Advances in algorithms for computing persistent homology have reduced the computation time drastically – as long as the algorithm does not exhaust the available memory. Following up on a recently presented parallel method for persistence computation on shared memory systems, we demonstrate that a simple adaption of the standard reduction algorithm leads to a variant for distributed systems. Our algorithmic design ensures that the data is distributed over the nodes without redundancy; this permits the computation of much larger instances than on a single machine. Moreover, we observe that the parallelism at least compensates for the overhead caused by communication between nodes, and often even speeds up the computation compared to sequential and even parallel shared memory algorithms. In our experiments, we were able to compute the persistent homology of filtrations with more than a billion (10⁹) elements within seconds on a cluster with 32 nodes using less than 10GB of memory per node.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b> 
We consider the problem of deciding whether the persistent homology group of a simplicial pair (K,L) can be realized as the homology H<sub>*</sub>(X) of some complex X with L ⊂ X ⊂ K. We show that this problem is NP-complete even if K is embedded in R³. As a consequence, we show that it is NP-hard to simplify level and sublevel sets of scalar functions on S³ within a given tolerance constraint. This problem has relevance to the visualization of medical images by isosurfaces. We also show an implication to the theory of well groups of scalar functions: not every well group can be realized by some level set, and deciding whether a well group can be realized is NP-hard.

Ulrich Bauer, Carsten Lange, and Max Wardetzky. Discrete and Computational Geometry 47:2 (2012), 347&ndash;377.
<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Given a function f on a surface and a tolerance &delta; > 0, we construct a function f<sub>&delta;</sub> subject to &#8214;f<sub>&delta;</sub> - f&#8214;<sub>&infin;</sub> &le; &delta; such that f<sub>&delta;</sub> has a minimum number of critical points. Our construction relies on a connection between discrete Morse theory and persistent homology and completely removes homological noise with persistence &le; 2&delta; from the input function f. The number of critical points of the resulting simplified function f<sub>&delta;</sub> achieves the lower bound dictated by the stability theorem of persistent homology. We show that the simplified function can be computed in linear time after persistence pairs have been computed.

<!-- 
We present an efficient algorithm for computing a function that minimizes the number of critical points among all functions within a prescribed distance &delta; from a given input function. The result is achieved by establishing a connection between discrete Morse theory and persistent homology. Our method completely removes homological noise with persistence less than 2&delta;, constructively proving that the lower bound on the number of critical points given by the stability theorem of persistent homology is tight in dimension two for any input function.

<td><strong>Persistence in discrete Morse Theory</strong><br>
PhD thesis, University of G&ouml;ttingen, 2011.
<br>
<small>
<b>Abstract:</b>
The goal of this thesis is to bring together two different theories about critical points of a scalar function and their relation to topology: Discrete Morse theory and Persistent homology. While the goals and fundamental techniques are different, there are certain themes appearing in both theories that closely resemble each other. In certain cases, the two threads can be joined, leading to new insights beyond the classical realm of one particular theory.
<p>
Discrete Morse theory provides combinatorial equivalents of several core concepts of classical Morse theory, such as discrete Morse functions, discrete gradient vector fields, critical points, and a cancelation theorem for the elimination of critical points of a vector field. Because of its simplicity, it not only maintains the intuition of the classical theory but allows to surpass it in a certain sense by providing explicit and canonical constructions that would become quite complicated in the smooth setting.
<p>
Persistent homology quantifies topological features of a function. It defines the birth and death of homology classes at critical points, identifies pairs of these (persistence pairs), and provides a quantitative notion of their stability (persistence).
<p>
Whereas (discrete) Morse theory makes statements about the homotopy type of the sublevel sets of a function, persistence is concerned with their homology. While homology is an invariant of homotopy equivalences, the converse is not true: not every map inducing an isomorphism in homology is a homotopy equivalence. In this thesis we establish a connection between both theories and use this combination to solve problems that are not easily accessibly by any single theory alone. In particular, we solve the problem of minimizing the number of critical points of a function on a surface within a certain tolerance from a given input function.

Ulrich Bauer, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, and Max Wardetzky.
Proceedings of ICNAAM 2010, 1022–1026.<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> We present first insights into the relation between two popular yet apparently dissimilar approaches to denoising
of one dimensional signals, based on (i) total variation (TV) minimization and (ii) ideas from topological persistence. While a
close relation between (i) and (ii) might phenomenologically not be unexpected, our work appears to be the first to make this
connection precise for one dimensional signals. We provide a link between (i) and (ii) that builds on the equivalence between
TV-L2 regularization and taut strings and leads to a novel and efficient denoising algorithm that is contrast preserving and
operates in <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>log<em>n</em>) time, where <em>n</em> is the size of the input.

<b>Abstract:</b> We propose a method to identify planar regions in volume

on a structured or unstructured grid. The algorithm uses an efficient
discretization scheme for the parameter space to obtain a running time

of plane normals in the discretized parameter space.
We apply our algorithm in an industrial setting and perform experiments
with real-world data generated by topology optimization algorithms,
where the planar regions represent portions of a mechanical part
that can be built using steel plate.

<td><strong>Assignment Problem with Constraints</strong><br>
Diploma Thesis &ndash; ETH Z&uuml;rich (10/2004  &ndash; 03/2005)<br>
<small> 
<b>Abstract:</b> Combinatorial optimisation plays an important role in logistics, and many of the basic problems and algorithms find a direct application in this area or even originate from it. For instance, the assignment problem asks for a cost-optimal assignment of workers to tasks or products to warehouse locations.
<br>
Additional constraints on the solutions, such as an equal distribution of products to warehouses, are however often required in real-world settings. An algorithm to solve this problem is developed based on Bertsekas' well-known auction algorithm.

The cycles of a graph (the subgraphs whose vertices have even degree) span a matroid; addition on this matroid is defined as the symmetric difference of the edges. A cycle basis is a maximal set of linearly independent cycles; a minimum cycle basis is a cycle basis with minimum edge count (or minimum total edge weight in the case of weighted graphs).

to a minimum cycle basis, plays an important role in computational
chemistry. However, an efficient and exact algorithm for computing an
